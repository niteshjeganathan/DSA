# DSA
## Algorithm Analysis
### Algorithm
* Set of rules/instructions that is to be followed to obtain a desired output from a given input

### Data Structure
* Orderly arrangement of data in computers to use it more efficiently

### Space Complexity 
* Memory space required for the successful execution

### Time Complexity
* Total times required for the successful execution

### Asymptotic Notations
* Big O Notation - Worst Case Scenaio
* Omega Notation - Best Case Scenario
* Theta Notation - Average Case Scenario
